<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An article of apparel may include may include a garment portion and at least one protective element. The garment portion and the protective element have a configuration that forms a gap, separation, or pleat structure through, for example, folding or overlapping of a textile element of the garment portion. The gap, separation, or pleat structure may permit the protective element to move independent of other portions of the apparel at the joint, thereby enhancing a range of movement of the individual and the overall comfort of the apparel.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Protective elements or materials that impart padding, cushioning, or otherwise attenuate impact forces are commonly incorporated into a variety of products. Athletic apparel, for example, often incorporates protective elements that shield the wearer from contact with other athletes, equipment, or the ground. More specifically, pads used in American football and hockey incorporate protective elements that provide impact protection to various parts of a wearer. Helmets utilized during American football, hockey, bicycling, skiing, snowboarding, and skateboarding incorporate protective elements that impart cushioning to the head during falls or crashes. Similarly, gloves utilized in soccer (e.g., by goalies) and hockey incorporate protective elements that provide protection to the hands of a wearer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An article of apparel is disclosed below that includes a garment portion and at least one protective element. The garment portion and the protective element have a configuration that forms a gap, separation, or pleat structure. As an example, the gap, separation, or pleat structure may permit the protective element to move independent of other portions of the apparel at the joint, thereby enhancing a range of movement of the individual and the overall comfort of the apparel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one configuration, the garment portion is formed from a plurality of joined textile elements and has a first fold and a second fold that form a pleat structure, the first fold being located outward from the second fold. The protective element is at least partially located within the first fold and absent from an area within the second fold.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another configuration, the garment portion is formed from at least a first textile element and a second textile element. The first textile element forms a first fold and a second fold that form a pleat structure, with the first fold being located outward from the second fold. The protective element is located within the first fold and has a first surface and an opposite second surface. The first surface is located outward from the second surface. Additionally, the first textile element is joined to the first surface and the second surface, and the second textile element is joined to the second surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In yet another configuration, the apparel includes a band for extending around a portion of a wearer, at least one textile element, and a protective element. The band is formed from a stretchable material and the textile element is joined to the band, with a portion of the textile element extending away from the band. The protective element is formed from a compressible material. A gap extends between the protective element and the portion of the textile element extending away from the band.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following discussion and accompanying figures disclose various articles of apparel that incorporate protective elements. As discussed in greater detail below, the protective elements (e.g., foam pads, a plurality of foam elements) may bunch or otherwise compress to restrict movement of an individual wearing the apparel, particularly in the area of a joint (e.g., hip, knee, shoulder, elbow). A gap, separation, or pleat structure, for example, permits the protective element to move independent of other portions of the apparel at the joint, thereby enhancing a range of movement of the individual and the overall comfort of the apparel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Apparel Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an individual <b>10</b> is depicted as wearing an article of apparel <b>100</b> with the general configuration of a pants-type garment, specifically a pair of shorts. In further configurations, concepts associated with apparel <b>100</b> may be incorporated into apparel having the configuration of a pair of pants, a shirt-type garment (e.g., long-sleeved shirt, short-sleeved shirt, jacket, coat, undershirt), headwear (e.g., hat, headband), a brace or covering (e.g., for a shoulder, elbow, knee, or ankle), or glove, for example. Although apparel <b>100</b> may be worn under other articles of apparel, apparel <b>100</b> may be worn alone, may be exposed, or may be worn over other articles of apparel. Apparel <b>100</b> may also be worn in combination with other pieces of equipment (e.g., athletic or protective equipment). Accordingly, the configuration of apparel <b>100</b> and the manner in which apparel <b>100</b> is worn by individual <b>10</b> may vary significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Apparel <b>100</b> is depicted individually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> as including a pelvic region <b>101</b> and a pair of leg regions <b>102</b> that extend outward from pelvic region <b>101</b>. Pelvic region <b>101</b> corresponds with a pelvic area of individual <b>10</b> and covers at least a portion of the pelvic area when worn. An upper area of pelvic region <b>101</b> defines a waist opening <b>103</b> that extends around a waist of individual <b>10</b> when apparel <b>100</b> is worn. Leg regions <b>102</b> correspond with a right leg and a left leg of individual <b>10</b> and cover at least a portion of the right leg and the left leg when worn. Lower areas of leg regions <b>102</b> each define a thigh opening <b>104</b> that extends around a thigh of individual <b>10</b> when apparel <b>100</b> is worn. Additionally, apparel <b>100</b> includes an exterior surface <b>105</b> that faces away from individual <b>10</b> when apparel <b>100</b> is worn, and apparel <b>100</b> includes an opposite interior surface <b>106</b> that faces toward individual <b>10</b> and may contact individual <b>10</b> when apparel <b>100</b> is worn.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of pelvic region <b>101</b> and leg regions <b>102</b> include a variety of textile elements (e.g., a base element <b>110</b>, a cover element <b>120</b>, a waistband <b>130</b>, as discussed below) that effectively form a garment portion of apparel <b>100</b>. That is, the textile elements are joined (e.g., at seams through stitching, adhesive bonding, or thermal bonding) to impart the configuration of the shorts-type garment to apparel <b>100</b>. The textile elements also form areas for receiving various protective elements <b>200</b>, which are incorporated into various areas of apparel <b>100</b> to impart padding, cushioning, or otherwise attenuate impact forces. When apparel <b>100</b> is worn during athletic activities, for example, protective elements <b>200</b> may protect individual <b>10</b> from contact with other athletes, equipment, or the ground. With regard to apparel <b>100</b>, protective elements <b>200</b> are located in both of pelvic region <b>101</b> and leg regions <b>102</b> and are positioned, more specifically, to protect the hips, thighs, and tailbone of individual <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Protective Element Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A portion of apparel <b>100</b> that includes one of protective elements <b>200</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9C</figref>. In general, protective element <b>200</b> includes a plurality of pad components <b>210</b> and two frame components <b>220</b> that are located between base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>. Although pad components <b>210</b> are secured to base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>, frame component <b>220</b> is unsecured to each of base element <b>110</b>, cover element <b>120</b>, and pad components <b>210</b>. Base element <b>110</b> forms a majority of interior surface <b>106</b> and is located to contact individual <b>10</b> when apparel <b>100</b> is worn, with waistband <b>130</b> forming a smaller portion of interior surface <b>106</b>. Cover element <b>120</b> extends over pad components <b>210</b> and is joined to base element <b>110</b> around the periphery of pad components <b>210</b>. A combination of base element <b>110</b>, cover element <b>120</b>, and waistband <b>130</b> forms, therefore, a majority of exterior surface <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b> cooperatively form an outer surface or covering for protective element <b>200</b>. That is, base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b> cooperatively form a pocket or void, in which pad components <b>210</b> and frame component <b>220</b> are located. Whereas base element <b>110</b> is depicted as having a generally planar configuration, cover element <b>120</b> extends over pad components <b>210</b> and frame components <b>220</b> and also along sides of pad components <b>210</b> to join with base element <b>110</b> (e.g., through stitching, an adhesive, or thermal bonding). Although protective element <b>200</b> may be incorporated into apparel <b>100</b> in a variety of ways, cover element <b>120</b> may be positioned exterior of base element <b>110</b>. An advantage to this configuration is that protective element <b>200</b> protrudes outward from apparel <b>100</b>, rather than protruding inward and toward individual <b>10</b>. In some configurations of apparel <b>100</b>, however, protective element <b>200</b> may protrude inward.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Textile elements may be utilized for base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b> in many configurations of apparel <b>100</b>. As examples, base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b> may be formed from knitted, woven, or non-woven textile elements that include rayon, nylon, polyester, polyacrylic, cotton, wool, or silk. Moreover, the textiles may be non-stretch, may exhibit one-directional stretch, or may exhibit multi-directional stretch, and the textiles may have a continuous configuration or may be mesh materials that define apertures. A variety of other materials may also be utilized for base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>, including various polymer sheets, leather, and synthetic leather, for example. Combinations of these materials (e.g., a polymer sheet bonded to a textile) may also be utilized for base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>. Although base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b> may be formed from the same material, each of base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b> may also be formed from different materials. Accordingly, a variety of materials are suitable for base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of pad components <b>210</b> includes a first surface <b>211</b>, an opposite second surface <b>212</b>, and a side surface <b>213</b> that extends between surfaces <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>. As discussed in greater detail below, protective element <b>200</b> includes an attached region <b>201</b> and a separated region <b>202</b>, as identified in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>A. In attached region <b>201</b>, pad components <b>210</b> are located between and secured to each of base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>. That is, first surface <b>211</b> is secured to cover element <b>120</b> and second surface <b>212</b> is secured to base element <b>110</b>. In separated region <b>202</b>, however, pad components <b>210</b> are located between a folded or overlapping portion of cover element <b>120</b> and secured to only cover element <b>120</b>. That is, first surface <b>211</b> and second surface <b>212</b> are both secured to cover element <b>120</b>. As discussed in greater detail below, the folded or overlapping portion of cover element <b>120</b> in separated region <b>202</b> forms a gap, separation, or pleat structure that permits protective element <b>200</b> to move independent of other portions of apparel <b>100</b> at the hip joint, thereby enhancing a range of movement of individual <b>10</b> and the overall comfort of apparel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the shapes of pad components <b>210</b> may vary significantly, each of surfaces <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> are depicted as having an elliptical or generally elongate shape with rounded end areas, and side surface <b>213</b> extends in a generally straight fashion between surfaces <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>. Pad components <b>210</b> are spaced evenly from each other and arranged in offset rows. Given the shape of protective element <b>200</b>, various pad components <b>210</b> adjacent to the periphery of protective element <b>200</b> exhibit a truncated or partial configuration. Although pad components <b>210</b> exhibit a common or equal thickness, various pad components <b>210</b> may have different thicknesses. For example, the pad components <b>210</b> located at the periphery may have lesser thickness than pad components <b>210</b> located in central areas. In general, the thickness of pad components <b>210</b> may range from 3 to 30 millimeters or more. As a related matter, pad components <b>210</b> are depicted as being a plurality of separate elements for purposes of example, but may be interconnected, may be a single element, or may have a variety of other conventional or non-conventional configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A variety of materials may be utilized for pad components <b>210</b>, including various polymer foam materials that return to an original shape after being compressed. Examples of suitable polymer foam materials for pad components <b>210</b> include polyurethane, ethylvinylacetate, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene foams. Moreover, both thermoplastic and thermoset polymer foam materials may be utilized. In some configurations of protective element <b>200</b>, pad components <b>210</b> may be formed from a polymer foam material with a varying density, or solid polymer or rubber materials may be utilized. Also, different pad components <b>210</b> may be formed from different materials, or may be formed from similar materials with different densities. The polymer foam materials forming pad components <b>210</b> attenuate impact forces to provide cushioning or protection. By selecting thicknesses, materials, and densities for each of the various pad components <b>210</b>, the degree of impact force attenuation may be varied throughout protective element <b>200</b> to impart a desired degree of cushioning or protection.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Within protective element <b>200</b>, frame components <b>220</b> are located between each of base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>. In contrast with pad components <b>210</b>, frame components <b>220</b> are unsecured to each of base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>, and frame components <b>220</b> are also unsecured to pad components <b>210</b>. This configuration permits frame components <b>220</b> to float or otherwise move relative to base element <b>110</b>, cover element <b>120</b>, and pad components <b>210</b>. Frame components <b>220</b> each have a first surface <b>221</b>, an opposite second surface <b>222</b>, and a side surface <b>223</b> extending between surfaces <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>. Additionally, frame components <b>220</b> define a plurality of apertures <b>224</b> having the general shape of pad components <b>210</b>. Given this configuration, frame components <b>220</b> extend around and between various pad components <b>210</b>. In areas where frame components <b>220</b> are present, the combination of pad components <b>210</b> and frame components <b>220</b> effectively form a foam layer within protective element <b>200</b>. Although the dimensions of apertures <b>224</b> may substantially match the dimensions of pad components <b>210</b>, frame components <b>220</b> may also be formed such that a gap extends between edges of apertures <b>224</b> and side surfaces <b>213</b> of pad components <b>230</b>. In some configurations, frame components <b>220</b> may be absent from protective element <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Frame components <b>220</b> are located in two areas (e.g., an upper area and a lower area) of protective element <b>200</b>. As an alternative, one or both frame components <b>220</b> may extend (a) throughout protective element <b>200</b> and define apertures <b>224</b> that extend around all of pad components <b>210</b>, (b) around only centrally-located pad components <b>210</b>, or (c) around only peripherally-located pad components <b>210</b>. Referring to the cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>, for example, frame components <b>220</b> are depicted as exhibiting lesser thickness (i.e., distance between surfaces <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>) than each of pad components <b>210</b>. An advantage of this configuration is that frame components <b>220</b> may move relative to base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>, thereby enhancing the flexibility of protective element <b>200</b>. As an example, frame components <b>220</b> may have a thickness of approximately 2 millimeters in a configuration wherein pad components <b>210</b> have a thickness of 7 millimeters. In other configurations, the thickness of frame components <b>220</b> may range from 1 to 20 millimeters or more. Although frame components <b>220</b> may exhibit lesser thickness than each of pad components <b>210</b>, frame components <b>220</b> may also be thicker than some or all of pad components <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Any of the variety of materials discussed above as being suitable for pad components <b>210</b> may also be utilized for frame components <b>220</b>, including various polymer foam materials that return to an original shape after being compressed. Examples of suitable polymer foam materials for frame component <b>220</b> include polyurethane, ethylvinylacetate, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene foams. Moreover, both thermoplastic and thermoset polymer foam materials may be utilized. In some configurations of protective element <b>200</b>, frame components <b>220</b> may be formed from solid polymer or rubber materials.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The compressible polymer foam materials forming pad components <b>210</b> and frame components <b>220</b> attenuate impact forces that compress or otherwise contact protective element <b>200</b>. When incorporated into apparel <b>100</b> or another article of apparel, for example, the polymer foam materials of pad components <b>210</b> and frame components <b>220</b> may compress to protect a wearer from contact with other athletes, equipment, or the ground. Accordingly, Protective element <b>200</b> may be utilized to provide cushioning or protection to areas of a wearer that are covered by protective element <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to attenuating impact forces, protective element <b>200</b> has an advantage of simultaneously providing one or more of breathability, flexibility, a relatively low overall mass, and launderability. When incorporated into an article of apparel, particularly apparel used for athletic activities, a wearer may perspire and generate excess heat. By utilizing a permeable textile for base element <b>110</b> and cover layer <b>120</b> and also forming gaps between adjacent pad components <b>210</b> and areas between pad components <b>210</b> and frame components <b>220</b>, areas for air to enter the apparel and for moisture to exit the apparel are formed through protective element <b>200</b>. More particularly, air and moisture may pass through base element <b>110</b> and cover layer <b>120</b>, between pad components <b>210</b> in areas where frame components <b>220</b> are absent, and between pad components <b>210</b> and frame components <b>220</b> in areas where frame components <b>220</b> are present to impart breathability to areas of the apparel having protective element <b>200</b>. Moreover, the materials and structure discussed above for protective element <b>200</b> impart flexibility and a low overall mass. Furthermore, the materials and structure discussed above permits protective element <b>200</b> to be laundered without significant shrinkage or warping, even when temperatures associated with commercial laundering processes are utilized. Accordingly, protective element <b>200</b> may simultaneously provide impact force attenuation, breathability, flexibility, a relatively low overall mass, and launderability to an article of apparel, such as apparel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Pleat Structure</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In separated region <b>202</b>, apparel <b>100</b> has a configuration that permits protective element <b>200</b> to move independent of other portions of apparel <b>100</b> to enhance the range of movement of individual <b>10</b> and the overall comfort of apparel <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, cover element <b>120</b> includes a first fold <b>121</b> and a second fold <b>122</b> that effectively form an S-shaped configuration in separated region <b>202</b>. Whereas first fold <b>121</b> wraps around various pad components <b>210</b> (i.e., from first surface <b>211</b> to second surface <b>212</b>), second fold <b>122</b> forms an overlapping area in cover element <b>120</b> and extends along base element <b>110</b> to join with waistband <b>130</b>. Although pad components <b>210</b> are present within first fold <b>121</b>, pad components are absent from an area within second fold <b>122</b>. Cover element <b>120</b> is secured to each first surface <b>211</b> of the various pad components <b>210</b>. Due to first fold <b>121</b>, cover element <b>120</b> is also secured to second surface <b>212</b> in at least separated region <b>202</b>. In attached region <b>201</b>, however, base element <b>110</b> is secured to second surface <b>212</b> of the various pad components <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An upper edge of protective element <b>200</b> is located adjacent to waistband <b>130</b>, which is formed of a stretchable material and extends around individual <b>10</b>. Often, waistband <b>130</b> extends above the hip joint of individual <b>10</b>, which places a portion of protective element <b>200</b> over the hip joint. More particularly, the portion of protective element <b>200</b> in separated region <b>202</b> is located over the hip joint, whereas the portion of protective element <b>200</b> in attached region <b>201</b> protects the hip and areas of the leg around the hip. A portion of cover element <b>120</b> is secured to waistband <b>130</b> and extends away from waistband <b>130</b>. Although areas of cover element <b>120</b> are secured to surfaces <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> of pad components <b>210</b>, the portion secured to waistband <b>130</b> and extending away from waistband <b>120</b> is unsecured to pad components <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The overall configuration discussed above forms pleat structure in apparel <b>100</b> that allows portions of protective element <b>200</b> to move independently. More particularly, the overall configuration of cover element <b>120</b> (i.e., through folds <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and the configuration of cover element <b>120</b> discussed above) allows protective element <b>200</b> to move or flex in separated region <b>202</b>. As a first example, which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a portion of protective element <b>200</b> may flex to form a gap or separation between protective element <b>200</b> and other areas of apparel <b>100</b>. That is, the pleat structure formed by cover element <b>120</b> allows the portion of protective element <b>200</b> in separated region <b>202</b> to flex, thereby forming the gap or separation. As a second example, which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the portion of protective element <b>200</b> in separated region <b>202</b> may move or slide over waistband <b>130</b> and areas of base element <b>110</b> and cover element <b>120</b>. If, for example, protective element <b>200</b> is pushed by an upward force, then the pleat structure in apparel <b>100</b> would allow protective element <b>200</b> to slide over waistband <b>130</b>, rather than bunching or compressing. Given that protective element <b>200</b> is located at a hip joint of individual <b>10</b>, the flexing to form a gap or separation and the sliding permits protective element <b>200</b> to move independent of other portions of apparel <b>100</b>, thereby enhancing a range of movement of individual <b>10</b> and the overall comfort of apparel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Aspects of apparel <b>100</b> may vary depending upon the intended use for apparel <b>100</b> and the product in which cushioning element <b>200</b> is incorporated. Moreover, changes to the dimensions, shapes, and materials utilized within protective element <b>200</b> may vary the overall properties of protective element <b>200</b>. That is, by changing the dimensions, shapes, and materials utilized within protective element <b>200</b>, the compressibility, impact force attenuation, breathability, flexibility, and overall mass of protective element <b>200</b> may be tailored to specific purposes or products.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further configurations of the portion of apparel <b>100</b> that includes protective element <b>200</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11E</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, frame components <b>220</b> are absent from protective element <b>200</b>. Aspects relating to pad components <b>210</b> may also vary. For example, the various pad components <b>210</b> have hexagonal shapes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, but may also be circular, rectangular, elliptical or any other regular or irregular shape. In another configuration, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, pad components <b>210</b> may be replaced by a single element of a foam material. The overall shape of protective element <b>200</b> may also vary significantly. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, protective element has a rectangular shape, but may also be circular, hexagonal, elliptical or any other regular or irregular shape. The location of protective element <b>200</b> may also vary. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11E and 11F</figref>, protective element <b>200</b> may be spaced from waistband <b>130</b> or may cover a portion of waistband <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The manner in which the pleat structure is formed may also vary in apparel <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, for example, cover element <b>120</b> forms first fold <b>121</b>, but an end of cover element <b>120</b> is secured to base element <b>110</b>. In this configuration, therefore, second fold <b>122</b> is absent. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> discloses a configuration wherein cover element <b>120</b> extends downward along side surface <b>223</b>, but is absent from second surface <b>212</b>, and base element <b>110</b> is unsecured to second surface <b>212</b> in separated region <b>202</b>. As a further example, depicts a configuration wherein base element <b>110</b> terminates and is joined to cover element <b>120</b> as second fold <b>122</b>. In each of these configurations, a gap, separation, or pleat structure is formed that permits protective element <b>200</b> to move independent of other portions of apparel <b>100</b>, thereby enhancing a range of movement of individual <b>10</b> and the overall comfort of the apparel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The invention is disclosed above and in the accompanying figures with reference to a variety of configurations. The purpose served by the disclosure, however, is to provide an example of the various features and concepts related to the invention, not to limit the scope of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize that numerous variations and modifications may be made to the configurations described above without departing from the scope of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims.</p>
